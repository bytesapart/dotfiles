# This script installs some of the post-installation scripts that I need
# the objective of this script would be, in it's final state, to
# a. Install all the pacman softwares I need
# b. Copy all the configurations that I would need.
# Therefore, this script will be a post installation script that will set up a lot of environment for me
# after the `archinstall` has been run once the arch iso boots up
